# fastforward-currentspeed
Check current speed before fastforwarding.
You can customize your speed using the default [ and ] buttons before using the fast forward feature,
allowing you to skip the need to set a default speed in config file,
and easily return to your preferred speed when you stop fast forwarding.

I've modified this using ChatGPT.
The original plan was to check the playback speed before each use of the fast forward feature,
but the current implementation does not fully achieve this.
Nonetheless,
if you do not need to alter the playback speed more than once,
the current implementation works exceptionally well.
